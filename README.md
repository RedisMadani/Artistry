# Artistry


## Description:
Artistry is a Swift app that demonstrates the implementation of dynamic height for table view cells based on their content. This app serves as a practical example following the tutorial [*Self-sizing Table View Cells*](https://www.raywenderlich.com/129059/self-sizing-table-view-cells) from Ray Wenderlich's tech blog. By showcasing this technique, the app provides an understanding of how to create self-sizing table view cells, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user interface.

## Features:

### 1. Dynamic Cell Height:
The primary focus of Artistry is to illustrate the process of setting up table view cells with dynamic heights. The app utilizes Auto Layout constraints and automatic dimension calculations to adjust cell heights based on their content. This ensures that the cell's layout adapts appropriately to different content lengths without any truncation or overlapping issues.

### 2. Table View Data:
The app includes a sample data set with variable content lengths to demonstrate the dynamic cell height functionality effectively. It populates the table view with this data, allowing you to observe how the cell heights adjust dynamically based on the content.

### 3. Customization:
Artistry provides flexibility for customization, enabling you to modify the table view cell design and appearance according to your requirements. You can customize the cell's layout, fonts, colors, and other visual elements to match your app's overall theme.

## Installation:
To run Artistry on your iOS device or simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
